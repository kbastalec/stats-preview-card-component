### What I learned

I learned how to implement
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
in my code in order to reuse color properties while styling the page. Also, I found out how to use the
[order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order) CSS property to lay out an item to where it needed to be given the screen size.
